Synopsis: Give it Time, Nira
In a world trapped in a relentless time loop, Nira stands on the brink of a groundbreaking discovery: time travel. With humanity's future hanging in the balance, she embarks on a mission to break free from the loop and prevent the catastrophic event that started it all—the interstellar games, where a coalition of rogue humans and aliens trapped Earth in an infinite cycle.

Nira's journey is fraught with challenges as she prepares to navigate the complexities of time travel. She studies the time machine, gathers intel, and pieces together the puzzle, only to realize that traveling through time without accounting for the movement of Earth in space could leave her stranded forever.

The story then shifts to a classroom where students grapple with the unresolved conclusion of Nira's tale. Guided by their professor, they explore the nature of unanswerable questions that consume human thought and time. The professor challenges them to recognize these questions as traps, prompting them to consider more productive inquiries.

As the students confront their own patterns of seeking answers to impossible questions, they learn that true progress comes from focusing on questions that yield fruitful results and help humanity grow. They realize that their own escape from the time loop isn't enough—they must create something meaningful with their finite time to help others recognize and avoid the trap.

Ultimately, "Give it Time, Nira" is a thought-provoking exploration of the human tendency to seek answers to unanswerable questions, and a call to redirect our energy toward questions that foster growth, collaboration, and progress.

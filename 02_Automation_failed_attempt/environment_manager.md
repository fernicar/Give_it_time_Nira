# Environment Manager: Setting and Atmosphere

## Primary Locations

### The Quantum Physics Laboratory
- Modern facility with glass walls and steel framework
- Temporal observation equipment dominates the center
- Time machine prototype in a secured chamber
- Vine-covered abandoned machine in future glimpses
- Security systems and monitoring equipment

### The Lecture Hall
- Traditional academic amphitheater
- Seats 24 students in tiered rows
- Large display screens for data presentation
- Classic chalkboard (symbolic of timeless wisdom)
- Windows showing passage of time through natural light

### The Research Archive
- Underground facility with temperature control
- Historical records of human questioning patterns
- Statistical data displays on waste calculations
- Digital and physical documentation storage

## Temporal Atmosphere

### Present Timeline
- Sterile, scientific environment

- Digital displays showing time measurements
- Security card access points

### Future Glimpses
- Abandoned lab sections
- Overgrown vegetation
- Dust-covered equipment
- Failed experiment remnants
- Warning signs in multiple languages

## Environmental Transitions

### Act 1: Scientific Setting
- Emphasis on technology and progress
- Clean, ordered, controlled environment
- Bright lighting and modern aesthetics

### Act 2: Philosophical Shift
- Gradual dimming of artificial lights
- Increasing natural light presence
- Visible wear on equipment
- Growing plant life in corners

### Act 3: Resolution Environment
- Balance of natural and artificial light
- Symbolic vine growth on unused equipment
- Clear contrast between "guardian" and "awakened" spaces
- Statistical displays showing time waste calculations

## Atmospheric Elements

### Sound Design
- Laboratory equipment humming
- Ventilation system background
- Time machine power-up sequences
- Silence during key revelations
- Student murmurs during awakening

### Visual Cues
- Time waste statistics on displays
- Shadow patterns suggesting passing time
- Changing seasons through windows
- Equipment wear patterns
- Student posture changes during awakening

### Environmental Progression
- From sterile to organic
- From controlled to natural
- From isolated to connected
- From artificial to authentic

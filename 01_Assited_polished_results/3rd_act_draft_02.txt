"But we can't just leave it unfinished!" one of the sixteen protested, his voice carrying the desperate edge of someone watching their familiar world crack. "The whole point of reading is to find answers!"

"Is it?" the professor asked quietly. "Or is that exactly the trap Nira discovered?"

The class had physically divided now - the sixteen 'guardians' clustered together, their papers forming a barrier between themselves and the growing group of students who dared to question the questions themselves. The statistics of escape had shifted: nine freed, sixteen bound, and the hour still young.

"Right now," the professor said, addressing the divided class, "you're all like Nira approaching the time machine. And like her, you face the lab's guardians—those who would keep you bound to the traditional path, even if warned about the infinite loop."

"But our story could still be about time travel!" several voices protested from the guardian group. "We could—"

"Look at the cover again," the professor interrupted gently. "The time machine, covered in vines, abandoned to time itself. What does that tell us about its power to break the loop?"

The first student straightened in her chair. "We don't need the machine at all, do we? We need a different kind of story—one that can be passed down through generations, warning them about which questions to avoid. A story about recognizing the trap before it's too late."

Her words cut through the tension like a beam of light. Twelve students now sat up straighter, their papers forgotten on their desks. The statistics had shifted again: the gravitational pull of understanding beginning to outweigh the comfort of endless questions.

"Think about it," she continued, her confidence growing with each word. "Nira's tragedy isn't about failing to time travel. It's about realizing that some questions are guaranteed to trap every generation. 'Why are we here?' 'What's the meaning of life?' They're like that time machine—they promise answers but only consume time."

The professor wrote a number on the board: "7,891,342,789 hours."

"What's that?" someone asked.

"A conservative estimate of human hours spent asking just one of these eternal questions last year alone," he replied quietly. "Multiply that by all of recorded history, by all the questions we know are traps, and the waste becomes..." he let the thought hang in the air.

"But if we can't warn them—" one student began.

"That's part of the gravity," another interrupted, understanding blooming. "Each person has to discover it themselves, has to feel the pull and choose to break free. No warning can prevent it because the questions themselves are part of becoming conscious."

The professor nodded. "So what questions should we be asking instead?"

The first student straightened. "Questions that move us forward. Not 'why are we here?' but 'what can we build together?' Not 'what's the meaning of life?' but 'how can we improve life for those around us?'"

"The collective awakening," the professor added, "doesn't require everyone to break free at once. It starts with small groups, like this one, choosing to redirect their energy toward questions that bear fruit."

The statistics had shifted one final time: fifteen students now sat in silent understanding, while the remaining guardians clutched their papers, still searching for the time travel story they'd expected to find. But the real story—the one about breaking free from questions that guaranteed only wasted time—had already done its work. And perhaps most importantly, those fifteen now understood that their own escape from the loop wasn't enough—their real work would be creating something new from their finite time, something that might help others recognize the trap before being pulled in too deep.

I would like you to create a story about consciousness breaking free from futile questions.

1. Design the protagonist and setting:
   - Create a character who discovers a metaphorical trap
   - Establish a scientific/academic setting
   - Define the initial sci-fi elements

2. Establish the core metaphor:
   - Design the "time loop" as humanity's cyclical questions
   - Create the "lab guardians" representing resistance to change
   - Develop the "time machine" as a symbol of futile solutions

3. Structure the three acts:
   - Act 1: Present as genuine sci-fi (time travel story)
   - Act 2: Transform into philosophical revelation
   - Act 3: Reveal the true meaning of the loop

4. Create supporting files:
   - Write "main_character.md" detailing protagonist's journey
   - Create "story_foundation.md" for metaphorical framework
   - Develop "main_storyline.md" for plot structure

5. Draft development:
   - Write "draft1.txt" focusing on sci-fi elements
   - Create "draft2.txt" introducing philosophical elements
   - Develop "draft3.txt" revealing metaphorical meaning

6. Environmental context:
   - Create "environment_manager.md" for setting details
   - Include classroom dynamics
   - Add statistical elements about time waste

7. Final drafts:
   - Write "final_draft.txt" incorporating all elements
   - Balance sci-fi and philosophical aspects
   - Include concrete statistics and awakening process

8. Review and enhance:
   - Cross-reference character consistency
   - Verify metaphorical alignment
   - Ensure statistical accuracy
   - Check guardian/awakened ratio progression

9. Expand dialogue and descriptions:
   - Add meaningful exchanges between students
   - Include professor's guiding revelations
   - Show gradual understanding spread

10. Final polish:
    - Maintain tension between sci-fi and philosophy
    - Track statistical shifts in understanding
    - End with hope for collective awakening

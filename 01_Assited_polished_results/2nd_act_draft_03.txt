The classroom buzzed with the particular energy of thwarted expectations. Students leaned forward in their seats, flipping back through the pages with increasing desperation. Each one searched for what they were certain must exist: a hidden resolution, a clever twist, anything to transform this apparent failure into the heroic victory they'd been conditioned to expect.

"That's it?" someone finally voiced their collective disappointment. "She just... gives up?"

The story had denied them everything they craved: no clever solution to beat the space-time problem, no satisfying escape from the loop, not even the comfort of a traditional ending. Instead, they faced an insurmountable physical law and the bitter taste of an unresolved conclusion.

"There has to be another way," another student insisted, embodying humanity's eternal refusal to accept uncomfortable truths. "Maybe if she calculated the Earth's position—"

"Or built a spacecraft that could—"

The professor observed their mounting frustration with knowing eyes. This was the precise state of cognitive dissonance he'd been waiting for—that uncomfortable space between expectation and reality where real learning could begin.

"Insanity," he wrote on the board, the chalk scratching through their theories, "is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results."

The class fell silent, but their minds raced on. Even now, recognizing the futility, they couldn't help but continue their mental orbit around the problem. The pull of those unanswerable questions was too strong, too familiar.

"But professor," a student raised her hand, her voice carrying a hint of defiance, "what does insanity have to do with a time travel story?"

The professor smiled. "Tell me, how many times have you asked yourself about the meaning of life?"

"Many times," she admitted, though something in her tone suggested she wasn't ready to give up that pursuit either.

"And how many times has anyone in human history found a definitive answer?"

"None, I suppose." The words came reluctantly.

"Yet each generation asks again. Each person spends precious time pursuing the same questions that billions before them failed to answer. Isn't that..." he gestured to the board.

The silence that followed wasn't just uncomfortable—it was the sound of minds confronting their own patterns. Each student recognized their own reflection in Nira's story: the endless circling of impossible questions, the waste of finite time on infinite puzzles.

"Now," the professor said quietly, "let's read Nira's story again. But this time, don't think about time travel. Think about time waste."

Some students reached for their papers, while others sat motionless. Each faced their own version of Nira's choice: to keep orbiting the same questions that had trapped countless others, or to step away from the machine of endless seeking. The real prison, they were beginning to understand, wasn't in Nira's story at all—it was in their own minds, in their unwillingness to let go of questions that promised everything and delivered nothing but wasted time.

The discomfort in the room wasn't just from a story that refused to end properly—it was the recognition that they too were caught in the same loop, asking the same questions, expecting different results. And like Nira, each would have to choose: continue the cycle, or step away from the machine.

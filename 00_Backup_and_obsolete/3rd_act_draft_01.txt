As papers rustled throughout the classroom, one student remained still, her eyes fixed on a point far beyond the walls. The professor's words—"think about time waste"—had triggered something different in her mind. While her classmates dove back into Nira's story, searching for new meanings in familiar words, she found herself doing the opposite: letting go.

"I don't need to read it again," she said quietly, but the words carried through the silence with unexpected weight. Twenty-three pairs of eyes turned to her, some confused, others almost offended by this break from collective action.

The professor's smile deepened with recognition. "And why not?"

"Because..." she paused, surprised by her own clarity, "I'd be doing exactly what the story warns against. Reading it again, expecting to find something different, when the real answer is in what we're doing right now, isn't it?"

The statistics of escape hung in the air: one student had broken free, while twenty-three others remained bound to the gravitational pull of the familiar loop, their papers still gripped tightly in their hands.

"Wait!" Another student's voice cut through the moment of clarity, his eyes bright with renewed excitement. "Don't you see? The time machine is still there in the lab! All those years, just waiting—like in the cover art with all the vines growing over it. Someone else could figure out the space problem, right? Maybe that's the real message!"

The first student felt the familiar pull—that gravitational force of hope wrapped in endless questions. For a moment, she wavered. It would be easier to rejoin her classmates, to dive back into the comfortable loop of possibility. The professor watched as the statistics threatened to return to zero escapees.

"The vines growing over the machine," the professor interjected softly, "how much time do they represent?"

The excited student faltered. "I... well, years, I guess. But that means—"

"More time wasted," the first student whispered, finding her footing again. "More generations asking the same questions."

"Let's return to our earlier question," the professor said, turning to the first student. "About rewriting the story's ending. You understand that creating a new ending might pull us away from today's lesson?"

She nodded, a small smile forming. "Yes, but at least we wouldn't be trapped reading the same story over and over. That's the real waste of time, isn't it?"

Her words sent ripples through the classroom. Eight students lowered their papers, their expressions shifting from confusion to dawning comprehension. The remaining sixteen clutched their copies tighter, becoming unwitting guardians of the loop they'd been warned about.

"But we can't just leave it unfinished!" one of the sixteen protested, his voice carrying the desperate edge of someone watching their familiar world crack. "The whole point of reading is to find answers!"

"Is it?" the professor asked quietly. "Or is that exactly the trap Nira discovered?"

The class had physically divided now - the sixteen 'guardians' clustered together, their papers forming a barrier between themselves and the growing group of students who dared to question the questions themselves. The statistics of escape had shifted: nine freed, sixteen bound, and the hour still young.

"Right now," the professor said, addressing the divided class, "you're all like Nira approaching the time machine. And like her, you face the lab's guardians—those who would keep you bound to the traditional path, even if warned about the infinite loop."

"But our story could still be about time travel!" several voices protested from the guardian group. "We could—"

"Look at the cover again," the professor interrupted gently. "The time machine, covered in vines, abandoned to time itself. What does that tell us about its power to break the loop?"

The first student straightened in her chair. "We don't need the machine at all, do we? We need a different kind of story—one that can be passed down through generations, warning them about which questions to avoid. A story about recognizing the trap before it's too late."

Her words cut through the tension like a beam of light. Twelve students now sat up straighter, their papers forgotten on their desks. The statistics had shifted again: the gravitational pull of understanding beginning to outweigh the comfort of endless questions.

"Think about it," she continued, her confidence growing with each word. "Nira's tragedy isn't about failing to time travel. It's about realizing that some questions are guaranteed to trap every generation. 'Why are we here?' 'What's the meaning of life?' They're like that time machine—they promise answers but only consume time."

The professor nodded. "And like Nira's spatial paradox..."

"These questions are impossible to resolve," another student joined in, papers finally lowered. "Not because they're too complex, but because asking them at all means we've already fallen into the trap."

"Every generation asks them," a third voice added, understanding dawning. "Every single one, with absolute certainty. And each time..."

"We waste our finite time," the first student finished. "Just like Nira almost wasted hers on an impossible journey."

The statistics had shifted one final time: fifteen students now sat in silent understanding, while the remaining guardians clutched their papers, still searching for the time travel story they'd expected to find. But the real story—the one about breaking free from questions that guaranteed only wasted time—had already done its work.

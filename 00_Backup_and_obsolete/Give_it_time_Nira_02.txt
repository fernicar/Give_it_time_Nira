#Give it time Nira.

##Chapter 1

Part of the world as we know it is about to change forever, at least that's what Nira was thinking, since she is about to embark in the first time travel ever made.

So, imagine this: Nira is about to do something crazy - she's gonna try to travel through time for the first time ever. If she can pull it off, she might just save humanity from a super bad fate. But here's the thing: she only knows about this fate because she's already lived through it... multiple times. Yeah, it's a time loop, and she's stuck in it.

Think about it like this: you're stuck in a never-ending Groundhog Day, but instead of just reliving the same day over and over, you're reliving the same entire timeline. It's like, you're born, you grow up, you live your life, and then... boom! You're back to being a baby again, with no memory of what just happened. And it just keeps happening, over and over and over.

Nira figures out that the loop started at this big event called the interstellar games, where some rogue humans and aliens teamed up to trap Earth in this never-ending cycle. It's like, they flipped a switch and suddenly, humanity was stuck in this infinite loop.

But who are these culprits, you ask? Well, it's a shady group of humans and aliens who wanted to gain ultimate power and control over the universe. They're like, a secret society of evil geniuses who thought they could outsmart the fabric of time itself.

The humans, led by a charismatic leader named Arlo, were a group of wealthy and influential individuals who wanted to ensure their own survival and dominance in the universe. They were like, "Hey, why settle for just being rich and powerful on one planet when we can be rich and powerful across the entire universe?"

The aliens, on the other hand, were a species known as the Xeridians. They were an advanced civilization that had been watching Earth from afar, studying humanity's development and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They were like, "Hey, these humans are getting too powerful, let's team up with the rogue humans and trap them in a time loop so we can study them forever!"

Together, the rogue humans and Xeridians created a device that could manipulate time itself, trapping Earth in an infinite loop. They thought they were being clever, but really, they just created a massive headache for Nira and the rest of humanity.

So, Nira decides to take matters into her own hands. She's all, "You know what? I've had enough of this time loop nonsense. I'm gonna break free and save humanity." And she starts prepping for her mission.

She spends weeks gathering intel, studying the time machine, and learning everything she can about the interstellar games. She's like a detective, trying to piece together the clues and figure out how to break the cycle. She talks to experts, reads ancient texts, and even tries to communicate with her past selves (yeah, it's weird, but she's desperate).

Finally, she's ready. She sneaks into the time machine lab, avoiding all the security cameras and alarms. She's like a ninja, sneaking around and gathering all the tools and equipment she needs. She's got her plan all mapped out, and she's ready to put it into action.

She sets the time machine to take her to the opening ceremony of the interstellar games, where she hopes to prevent the loop from starting in the first place. She's got her heart racing, her palms are sweating, and she's basically holding her breath as she prepares to press the button.

But then, she has a major "oh no" moment. She realizes that if she travels to the future, she'll never be able to come back to Earth. Why? Because the planet is moving really, really fast through space, and if she travels even just a millisecond, she'll end up lost in space with no way to get back home.

It's like, imagine you're on a train, and you get off at the next stop. But the train keeps moving, and you can't catch up to it. That's basically what would happen to Nira if she travels through time without being able to navigate through space.

She's standing there, frozen in shock, for like 20 seconds. She can't believe she didn't think of this before. She's been so focused on breaking the time loop that she forgot about the whole "space" thing.

And then, she just walks out of the lab, abandoning her plan. She's all, "Well, I guess I'm stuck in this loop forever." It's like, she's back to square one, but this time, she's even more frustrated because she knows how close she was to breaking free.

That's the major problem with time travel, folks. You can't just hop through time without also being able to navigate through space. And that's why Nira, and the rest of humanity, are still stuck in this crazy time loop.

The End.

##Chapter 2

The classroom buzzed with the particular energy of thwarted expectations. Students leaned forward in their seats, flipping back through the pages with increasing desperation. Each one searched for what they were certain must exist: a hidden resolution, a clever twist, anything to transform this apparent failure into the heroic victory they'd been conditioned to expect.

"That's it?" someone finally voiced their collective disappointment. "She just... gives up?"

The story had denied them everything they craved: no clever solution to beat the space-time problem, no satisfying escape from the loop, not even the comfort of a traditional ending. Instead, they faced an insurmountable physical law and the bitter taste of an unresolved conclusion.

"There has to be another way," another student insisted, embodying humanity's eternal refusal to accept uncomfortable truths. "Maybe if she calculated the Earth's position—"

"Or built a spacecraft that could—"

The professor observed their mounting frustration with knowing eyes. This was the precise state of cognitive dissonance he'd been waiting for—that uncomfortable space between expectation and reality where real learning could begin.

"Insanity," he wrote on the board, the chalk scratching through their theories, "is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results."

The class fell silent, but their minds raced on. Even now, recognizing the futility, they couldn't help but continue their mental orbit around the problem. The pull of those unanswerable questions was too strong, too familiar.

"But professor," a student raised her hand, her voice carrying a hint of defiance, "what does insanity have to do with a time travel story?"

The professor smiled. "Consider the nature of questions that lead nowhere," he said. "They often promise profound answers but leave us endlessly searching, never finding true resolution."

The students exchanged puzzled glances, unsure where he was leading them.

"Think about the kind of questions that have persisted through generations, yet remain unresolved," the professor continued. "They consume our thoughts and time, compelling us to seek answers that elude us, much like the time loop in Nira's story."

Understanding dawned on some faces, while others still struggled to grasp the concept.

"The real dilemma," the professor said, "is recognizing these questions for what they are: a trap that keeps us from moving forward. They create an illusion of progress, but in reality, they only waste our finite time."

The silence that followed wasn't just uncomfortable—it was the sound of minds confronting their own patterns. Each student recognized their own reflection in Nira's story: the endless circling of impossible questions, the waste of finite time on infinite puzzles.

"Now," the professor said quietly, "let's read Nira's story again. But this time, don't think about time travel. Think about time waste."

Some students reached for their papers, while others sat motionless. Each faced their own version of Nira's choice: to keep orbiting the same questions that had trapped countless others, or to step away from the machine of endless seeking. The real prison, they were beginning to understand, wasn't in Nira's story at all—it was in their own minds, in their unwillingness to let go of questions that promised everything and delivered nothing but wasted time.

The discomfort in the room wasn't just from a story that refused to end properly—it was the recognition that they too were caught in the same loop, asking the same questions, expecting different results. And like Nira, each would have to choose: continue the cycle, or step away from the machine.

##Chapter 3

"But we can't just leave it unfinished!" one of the sixteen protested, his voice carrying the desperate edge of someone watching their familiar world crack. "The whole point of reading is to find answers!"

"Is it?" the professor asked quietly. "Or is that exactly the trap Nira discovered?"

The class had physically divided now - the sixteen 'guardians' clustered together, their papers forming a barrier between themselves and the growing group of students who dared to question the questions themselves. The statistics of escape had shifted: nine freed, sixteen bound, and the hour still young.

"Right now," the professor said, addressing the divided class, "you're all like Nira approaching the time machine. And like her, you face the lab's guardians—those who would keep you bound to the traditional path, even if warned about the infinite loop."

"But our story could still be about time travel!" several voices protested from the guardian group. "We could—"

"Look at the cover again," the professor interrupted gently. "The time machine, covered in dust, abandoned to time itself. What does that tell us about its power to break the loop?"

The first student straightened in her chair. "We don't need the machine at all, do we? We need a different kind of story—one that can be passed down through generations, warning them about which questions to avoid. A story about recognizing the trap before it's too late."

Her words cut through the tension like a beam of light. Twelve students now sat up straighter, their papers forgotten on their desks. The statistics had shifted again: the gravitational pull of understanding beginning to outweigh the comfort of endless questions.

"Think about it," she continued, her confidence growing with each word. "Nira's tragedy isn't about failing to time travel. It's about realizing that some questions are guaranteed to trap every generation. 'Why are we here?' 'What's the meaning of life?' They're like that time machine—they promise answers but only consume time."

The professor wrote a number on the board: "7,891,342,789 hours."

"What's that?" someone asked.

"A conservative estimate of human hours spent asking just one of these eternal questions last year alone," he replied quietly. "Multiply that by all of recorded history, by all the questions we know are traps, and the waste becomes..." he let the thought hang in the air.

"But if we can't warn them—" one student began.

"That's part of the gravity," another interrupted, understanding blooming. "Each person has to discover it themselves, has to feel the pull and choose to break free. No warning can prevent it because the questions themselves are part of becoming conscious."

The professor nodded. "So what questions should we be asking instead?"

The first student straightened. "Questions that move us forward. Not 'why are we here?' but 'what can we build together?' Not 'what's the meaning of life?' but 'how can we improve life for those around us?'"

"The collective awakening," the professor added, "doesn't require everyone to break free at once. It starts with small groups, like this one, choosing to redirect their energy toward questions that bear fruit."

The statistics had shifted one final time: fifteen students now sat in silent understanding, while the remaining guardians clutched their papers, still searching for the time travel story they'd expected to find. But the real story—the one about breaking free from questions that guaranteed only wasted time—had already done its work. And perhaps most importantly, those fifteen now understood that their own escape from the loop wasn't enough—their real work would be creating something new from their finite time, something that might help others recognize the trap before being pulled in too deep.

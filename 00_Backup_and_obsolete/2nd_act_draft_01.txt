"Insanity," the professor wrote on the board, "is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results."

The class sat in silence, still processing the story of Nira they had just read. One student raised her hand.

"But professor, what does insanity have to do with a time travel story?"

The professor smiled. "Tell me, how many times have you asked yourself about the meaning of life?"

"Many times," she admitted.

"And how many times has anyone in human history found a definitive answer?"

"None, I suppose."

"Yet each generation asks again. Each person spends precious time pursuing the same questions that billions before them failed to answer. Isn't that..." he gestured to the board.

The class fell silent again, but this time with understanding dawning on their faces.

"Now, let's read Nira's story again. But this time, don't think about time travel. Think about time waste."

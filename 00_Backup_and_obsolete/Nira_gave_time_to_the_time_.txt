Part of the world as we know it is about to change for ever, at least that's what Nira was thinking, since she is about to embark in the first time travel ever made, should she manage to acomplish this dangerous feat, she would save the humanity from a certain disgrace. However, how could she know this disgrace would ever happen? well, at least it is possible that the catastrophic event had happened several times, in fact, she believes it is a loop that we could not escape, and has been like this for who knows when.
The moment she regain knoledge about the loop was during the time machine first tests, where the field of effect protected her from going trought the loop, however, the tests didn't last long enough for here to do something to free herself, so now she decided to go in secret and take control of the machine to free us all from the loop, however, it would be not a easy feat, since she understood the point in time she could only atempt to go is to the future, a specific event where the loop started, the opening ceremony of the first interstellar games, such event were a group of rogue humans and aliens put a plan in motion to trap the earth in a never ending loop, so the main quest would be no easy for her, let alone that she will have no understanding of the future, nor any allies, so now she decided to learn from the posible ancestors and their lives to try to persuade their grand grand childrens in the future to help her free us from the loop.
Everything was going well, she gathered a lot of contacts, tools and equipments that may help, bypased the security of the time machine lab, and before she put the time machine in motion an epifany came to her, she stoped, she shoocked without breathing for about 20 seconds, and then she left the lab, without going to the future, she just realized what she was about to do, by setting the time machine to the future, her death was certain, she could travel to any time of her choice but, ... , yes, you guess it, just traveling to any time and she will never be in Earth any more, after all, Earth orbit to the Sun, which obit to the milky gallaxy, the orbit speed is so high that she will need to travel just one milisecond and may land in empty space, since the entire Solar System would offset so much that she will never see it again. That's the main problem of time traveling, you could never travel time if you don't have the means to travel space, and that's is why we are still traped in this loop. The end.

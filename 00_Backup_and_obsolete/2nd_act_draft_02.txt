The classroom buzzed with restless energy. Students leaned forward in their seats, flipping back through the pages, searching for missed clues, hidden meanings, anything that might offer the satisfaction the ending had denied them.

"That's it?" someone finally voiced what everyone was thinking. "She just... gives up?"

"There has to be another way," another student insisted. "Maybe if she calculated the Earth's position—"

"Or built a spacecraft that could—"

The professor watched as they did exactly what humans had done for millennia: refused to accept an uncomfortable truth, desperately seeking alternatives that didn't exist.

"Insanity," he wrote on the board, the chalk scratching through their theories, "is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results."

The class fell silent, but their minds didn't. Each student was still trying to solve Nira's problem, still seeking that satisfying resolution, still refusing to let go.

"But professor," a student raised her hand, her voice carrying a hint of defiance, "what does insanity have to do with a time travel story?"

The professor smiled. "Tell me, how many times have you asked yourself about the meaning of life?"

"Many times," she admitted, though something in her tone suggested she wasn't ready to give up that pursuit either.

"And how many times has anyone in human history found a definitive answer?"

"None, I suppose." The words came reluctantly.

"Yet each generation asks again. Each person spends precious time pursuing the same questions that billions before them failed to answer. Isn't that..." he gestured to the board.

The silence that followed wasn't one of peace. It was the silence of minds wrestling with an unwelcome revelation, each student feeling the gravitational pull of those eternal questions even as they began to recognize their futility.

"Now," the professor said quietly, "let's read Nira's story again. But this time, don't think about time travel. Think about time waste."

Some students reached for their papers. Others sat motionless, caught between the comfort of seeking and the discomfort of understanding. Each one faced the same choice Nira had: to keep orbiting the same questions, or to step away from the machine that promised answers but delivered only endless loops.

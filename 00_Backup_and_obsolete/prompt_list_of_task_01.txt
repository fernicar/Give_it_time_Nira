I would like you to create a fictional story about a man, wo is travelling.
1. name and design the caracter.
2. determine his location and destination.
3. devise a method of transport.
4. use the hero's journey.
5. write a new file named "main_character.md" into which all details about the main character should go.
6. write a plot overview to summarise the sory into a new file named "main_storyline.md"
7. read the main_storyline.md and cross reference defined characteristics updating the story where needed, create "draft2.txt" and add the full updated story.
8. read the main_storyline.md again, then create a new file named "environment_manager.md" which will self describe itself as the environment, by injecting text into and around existing text with contextual and temporal awareness.
9. read the "draft2.txt" then excluding speech, expand text by a factor of three, then write the new complete updated "draft3.txt"
10. read the updated "draft3.txt" and use the "environment_manager.md" guidance to inject text describing the environmental details as instructed to expand the story, the final draft should be named "final_draft.txt"
